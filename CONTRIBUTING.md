# Contributing to RapidPro

Contributions to the RapidPro projects are highly appreciated! 

We accept contributions in the form of:
 * bug reports 
 * pull requests for code changes
 * documentation updates

All non-trivial pull requests, especially those with functional changes should first open a ticket to discuss approach and likelyhood of inclusion in the project.

Note that all pull requests must maintain 100% unit test coverage (without new no-covers) and pass all unit tests.

RapidPro is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 and your contributions will be licensed in the same way. Note that contributing does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
